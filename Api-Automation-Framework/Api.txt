IDEMPOTENT - An idempotent API is an API (Application Programming Interface) that can be called multiple times with the same parameters and produce the same result each time, without causing any side effects or unintended changes to the system.

HEAD  -  It is the same as GET, but only transfers the status line and header section.

POST - Creates new resource each time and it is not Idempotent.

OPTIONS - It describes the communication option for the target resource. It is giving information about Api.


RestAssured :-
